                        <p>Pink hues from the setting sun cast a glow on a lone polar bear striding across the tundra
                            near
                            Churchill. A group of wildlife enthusiasts photographed the scene from an early version of a
                            Tundra
                            Buggy. With all windows open and heat turned off to keep cameras from fogging, frost nipped
                            at
                            their
                            fingers—but no one cared.</p>

                            inspired by the bears that he led the group to form a nonprofit, now called Polar Bears

                        Continent:
                    </span>North America</p>

                        Species:
                    </span>Polar bear, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Pacific salmon, Seals</p>
                <p> The Arctic is a region like no other in the world and it's warming twice as fast, bringing with it
                    rapid change impacting life on land and at sea.
                    About 4 million people live in the Arctic, spread out over eight countries, including the United
                    States. Diverse landscapes—from the sea ice to coastal wetlands, upland tundra, mountains, wide
                    rivers, and the sea itself—support abundant wildlife and many cultures. Of all the wildlife in the
                    Arctic, the polar bear is the most fitting icon for this region. It's amazing adaptation to life in
                    the harsh Arctic environment makes it an impressive species.
                    Within America's Arctic, the remarkably productive waters of the Bering Sea attract marine mammals,
                    such as gray whales, which travel great distances to forage and raise their young.
                    The Arctic, including the Bering, Beaufort and Chukchi seas, now faces an uncertain future due to
                    climate change, mining, shipping, oil and gas development, and overfishing.
